# Data Dictionary

Covers the raw ingestion layer (`data/raw/`) and the typed validated layer
(`data/validated/`). Warehouse table dictionaries are added by the DDL task.

## Validated layer — typed Parquet (`data/validated/`)

`src/validation/` (`make stage`) standardizes the raw pipe-delimited RIF CSVs
into typed Parquet without altering values (leading zeros, signed synthetic
ids, and ICD codes are preserved as text). Dtypes are resolved by explicit,
auditable rules in `src/validation/schemas.py`:

| Kind | Rule | Arrow type |
|---|---|---|
| date | name matches `_DT` + optional index digit (e.g. `CLM_FROM_DT`, `PRCDR_DT1..25`), or `COVSTART` | `date32[day]` |
| money | name ends `_AMT`, or `CLM_PPS_CPTL_DRG_WT_NUM` | `float64` |
| int | name ends `_CNT`/`_MONS`/`_DAYS`/`_QTY`/`_YR`, or `CLM_LINE_NUM` | `int64` (nullable) |
| string | everything else — codes (`_CD`), ids (`_NUM`, `_NPI`, `_ID`), ZIP, switches (`_SW`/`_IND`) | `string` |

Dates parse with format `%d-%b-%Y` (e.g. `25-Mar-2015`); empty strings become
null, and non-empty values that fail to parse are counted per column and
reported (data-quality signal), never silently dropped.

Staged outputs (row counts reconcile exactly to the raw source):

| Parquet | Rows | Columns | Typed date cols |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data/validated/beneficiary_2024.parquet` | 9,660 | 185 | 3 |
| `data/validated/inpatient.parquet` | 58,066 | 197 | 33 |

Known limitation: a few RIF columns whose names are truncated so the `_DT`
token is not the final token (e.g. `NCH_BENE_MDCR_BNFTS_EXHTD_DT_I`,
`NCH_ACTV_OR_CVRD_LVL_CARE_THRU`) remain string-typed pending the official RIF
data dictionary. Their raw text is preserved losslessly; only the type hint is
conservative. These are rarely populated in the synthetic data.

## Data contracts, quarantine, and reconciliation (`make contracts`)

`src/validation/contracts.py` enforces the validated-layer contracts:

| Contract | Level | Action on failure |
|---|---|---|
| required columns | table | fail the table |
| key uniqueness (`BENE_ID`; `CLM_ID`+`CLM_LINE_NUM`) | table | fail the table + quarantine dup rows |
| date ordering (`CLM_FROM_DT ≤ CLM_THRU_DT`) | row | quarantine the row |
| non-negative money (`CLM_PMT_AMT`, `CLM_TOT_CHRG_AMT`, …) | row | quarantine the row |

Failing rows are isolated in `rcm.dq_quarantine` / `data/validated/quarantine/
quarantine.parquet` (columns: `table_name`, `contract`, `entity_key`, `reason`)
— never silently dropped. `make contracts` also writes
`data/validated/reconciliation_report.json` (per-table rows, contract results,
quarantine counts, and staged-vs-source row reconciliation). On this subset:
all contracts pass, 0 quarantined, staged rows tie to source (9,660 / 58,066).
The staging layer additionally counts present-but-unparseable money/int values
(`numeric_null_from_nonempty`) alongside dates, so a dirty value surfaces as a
data-quality signal instead of a silent null.

## Raw layer — CMS Synthetic Medicare RIF (SOURCE, vintage 2023-04)

Files are **pipe-delimited** (`|`) plain text. Identifiers (`BENE_ID`,
`CLM_ID`, `PRVDR_NUM`, NPIs) are **synthetic** and do not correspond to real
people, providers, or facilities.

### `beneficiary_2024.csv` — Master Beneficiary Summary Base (enrollment)
Grain: one row per synthetic beneficiary per reference year. Key: `BENE_ID`.

(185 columns total; monthly arrays `_01..12` carry the per-month values.)

### `inpatient.csv` — Inpatient FFS claims
Grain: claim line (claim header repeats across revenue-center lines).
Keys: `CLM_ID` (claim), `CLM_ID` + `CLM_LINE_NUM` (line). FK: `BENE_ID`.

| `CLM_LINE_NUM`, `REV_CNTR`, `HCPCS_CD` | Revenue-center line: line number, revenue code, HCPCS. |

> Note: the synthetic RIF has service and processing dates but no explicit
> submission/payment timeline. Submission → adjudication → payment timing and
> denial/appeal fields are added by the SIMULATED layer (Phase 2), so the
> date-ordering contract (service ≤ submission ≤ adjudication ≤ payment) is
> enforced against `sim_` fields there; the SOURCE contract enforces
> `CLM_FROM_DT ≤ CLM_THRU_DT`.

## Raw layer — NPPES provider extract (REFERENCE, vintage 2026-07)

### `nppes_ri_extract.csv`
State-filtered (Rhode Island) subset of the NPPES monthly dissemination main
file (`npidata_pfile_*`). Comma-delimited, fields quoted. Standard ~330-column
NPPES layout. Key: `NPI`. Filter column: `Provider Business Practice Location
Address State Name`. Real NPIs — linked to synthetic claims only via the
SIMULATED crosswalk.

## Raw layer — CMS Hospital General Information (REFERENCE, vintage 2026-04)

### `reference/hospital_general_information.csv`
CMS Hospital General Information (dataset `xubh-q36u`). Comma-delimited, quoted.
5,432 real facilities across 56 states/territories. Key columns for the
SIMULATED crosswalk: `Facility ID` (CCN), `State`, `Hospital Type` (stratifiers).
Real CCNs — linked to synthetic claims only via the seeded crosswalk (§3.4).

## Warehouse layer — star schema (`rcm`, PostgreSQL 16)

Built by `src/ingestion/star_transform.py` + `sql/ddl/` (`make warehouse` loads
live PostgreSQL 16; `make validate-warehouse` runs the acceptance checks against
it; `make warehouse-check` is the DuckDB CI mirror of the same check SQL). Every
dimension reserves surrogate key
`0` for an **Unknown** member so facts never carry null foreign keys. Synthetic
provider ids are flagged `is_synthetic_id = true` — they are NOT real CCNs/NPIs.

Dimensions:

| Table | Grain | Natural key | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dim_date` | one calendar day | `date_key` (yyyymmdd) | key 0 = Unknown/undated; keys are date-ordered ints. |
| `dim_beneficiary` | one beneficiary | `bene_id` | demographics + coverage months; SOURCE. |
| `dim_provider` | one billing provider | `prvdr_num` | synthetic CCN/NPI; `is_synthetic_id`. |
| `dim_drg` | one MS-DRG code | `drg_cd` | `drg_desc` null until MS-DRG REFERENCE loaded. |
| `dim_discharge_status` | one status code | `discharge_status_cd` | SOURCE. |

Facts:

| Table | Grain | Key | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fact_inpatient_claim` | one claim (`CLM_ID`) | `claim_sk` | claim-header measures (payment/charges constant per claim); FKs to all dims; `length_of_stay_days` is DERIVED; CHECK constraints enforce non-negative money and `from_date_key ≤ thru_date_key`. |
| `fact_claim_revenue_line` | one revenue line (`CLM_ID`+`CLM_LINE_NUM`) | `claim_line_sk` | rev code / HCPCS; FK to claim. |
| `fact_claim_diagnosis` | one (claim, diagnosis slot) | `claim_dgns_sk` | long form of `ICD_DGNS_CD1..25` + POA; only non-empty codes. |

Loaded counts (this subset, reconciled to source): 20,867 claims / 58,066
revenue lines / 338,024 diagnoses; dims 9,660 beneficiaries, 4,876 providers,
167 DRGs. 910 claims have a null billing provider and 2,741 a null DRG — both
routed to the Unknown member (reported as data-quality metrics, not errors).

SIMULATED crosswalk tables (CLAUDE.md §3.4 — seeded random assignment, NOT a
real linkage; seed in `config/simulation.yaml:linkage.crosswalk_seed`):

| Table | Grain | Maps | Stratified by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sim_facility_crosswalk` | one synthetic billing provider (`sim_prvdr_num`, FK to `dim_provider`) | → real facility CCN (Hospital General Information) | state (SSA→postal) + acute-care type |
| `sim_provider_crosswalk` | one synthetic attending physician (`sim_at_physn_npi`) | → real Medicare NPI (Medicare Physician by Provider) | coherent state + inpatient-plausible specialty |

Each row carries `match_rule`, `same_state`, `crosswalk_seed`, and
`provenance='SIMULATED'`. On this subset: 4,876 facility rows and 2,463 provider
rows, 100% same-state matches. Same seed reproduces an identical crosswalk.

## Raw layer — Medicare Physician & Other Practitioners by Provider (REFERENCE, vintage 2024)

### `reference/medicare_providers_extract.csv`
Compact column extract (NPI, entity code, state, specialty, name) of the CMS
"Medicare Physician & Other Practitioners - by Provider" dataset (D24 release).
1,296,739 real providers, nationwide. Provider pool for the SIMULATED
`sim_provider_crosswalk`. Real NPIs — linked to synthetic claims only via that
crosswalk. (The full ~485 MB source is checksummed then deleted; only the
extract is retained.)
